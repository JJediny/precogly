"""What the MCP endpoint reads, and as whom.

`ORMReader` is Precogly's half of the data-access protocol `precogly_mcp` defines: a
tool never fetches for itself, and mounted in this process it cannot, since the
caller's token is audience-bound to /mcp and django-oauth-toolkit refuses it at
/api/. What crosses into the data is the user the verifier resolved.

The rows are handed to the pydantic models the tools validate them with, which is the
strongest thing pinned here. Those models live in the other repository, so a
serializer change that would break a tool has nothing else to fail against — it would
otherwise surface as a validation error inside an agent's answer, or as a field
quietly missing from one.

Async methods are driven with `async_to_sync`. The ORM work inside them runs under
`sync_to_async(thread_sensitive=True)`, which keeps it on the calling thread, so it
sees the data this TestCase has created inside its transaction. Without that it would
run on another thread, outside the transaction, and every fixture below would look
absent.
