"""Which tokens `/mcp` accepts, and which it refuses.

`DjangoAccessTokenVerifier` is the endpoint's authorization boundary: it turns a
bearer string into a user id, and every row a tool later reads is scoped to that id.
Returning `None` is how the SDK is told to answer 401, so each refusal below is an
assertion that `verify_token` returned nothing.

The audience cases walk the real authorization flow rather than building an
`AccessToken` row directly. The check they exist for is that a `resource` parameter
sent at `/o/authorize/` survives into the column this verifier reads — a constructed
row would still satisfy the test if django-oauth-toolkit stopped persisting it. The
remaining refusals use built rows, since no flow produces a token naming no user.

The audience is a literal here rather than `settings.MCP_RESOURCE_URL`. What is
pinned is the verifier's behaviour for whatever audience it was constructed with;
that the advertised and enforced values agree is structural, since `config.mcp_mount`
passes one variable to both consumers.

`verify_token` is async and does its ORM work under
`sync_to_async(thread_sensitive=True)`, so `async_to_sync` keeps it on the calling
thread and inside this TestCase's transaction — the same arrangement
`test_mcp_reader` documents.
