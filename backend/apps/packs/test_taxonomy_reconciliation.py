    Rebuilding those joins means re-reading them from disk for every pack, not
    only the packs being imported this run. Two callers have to do it, and
    neither did:

      * `sync_all_packs_from_source()` ran the pass only under `if force:`, so
        a non-forced sync that re-imported a bumped taxonomy pack left the
        joins destroyed and unrebuilt.
      * `import_single` never ran it at all.

    Both are reachable with an ordinary upgrade: bump a taxonomy pack, leave
    the pack carrying its joins unbumped, sync.

class SinglePackImportScopeTests(SimpleTestCase):
    """`import_single` reconciles after taxonomy packs and nothing else.

    Only a taxonomy pack owns `ExternalTaxonomy` rows, so only a taxonomy pack
    can invalidate or satisfy another pack's joins. Verified against the live
    catalogue: all ten packs owning taxonomy rows declare `pack_type: taxonomy`,
    and no pack of any other type owns one. Re-reading 39 packs' join files
    after an unrelated import is therefore pure cost.

    The scope is `pack_type` alone, not `pack_type and existing and force`.
    Gating on a re-import would cover only half the problem: a join also fails
    to resolve when the taxonomy pack owning the code has not been imported yet,
    which is a *first* import, and those joins sit as PendingTaxonomyOverlay
    rows until a pass like this settles them.
