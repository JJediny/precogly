"""Who may read which threat models.

`ThreatModelQuerySet.visible_to` is the entire read boundary. `CanWrite` and
`IsSecurityTeam` both return True for safe methods (`apps/core/permissions.py`), so
nothing else narrows a read, and the MCP endpoint reaches the queryset with no
permission classes running at all — `apps/core/mcp.py` resolves a user from a bearer
token and calls this directly.

`account()` below deletes what the account was given on creation, and that is
load-bearing rather than tidiness. `create_personal_workspace`
(`apps/organizations/signals.py`) puts every new user in the primary organization, or,
where there is no primary organization — which is every test database — in a workspace
of its own as **security team**. Left alone, every fixture here would satisfy the
security-team branch, and the plain-member cases would pass while testing nothing.
