# django-oauth-toolkit publishes two kinds of metadata: RFC 8414 for the authorization
# server, and RFC 9728 for a protected resource. Only the first describes this server.
# The second describes /mcp, and the MCP endpoint publishes its own at
# /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp, out of the same AuthSettings that its token
# verifier enforces — so the scopes it advertises are the scopes it requires. Routing
# both put two documents on that one path: Django builds its from
# OAUTH2_PROVIDER["SCOPES"], so it named /o as the authorization server and advertised
# `write` for an endpoint with no write tool, and the dispatch order in config/wsgi.py
# decided which one a client saw.
#
# Selected by name, since the resource patterns are the ones to leave out and the URL
# shapes belong to django-oauth-toolkit. A protected resource served by Django itself —
# /api/, say — would want them back, with /mcp excluded.

    # A second, server-rendered login, because the React one yields a JWT and no
    # Django session and the authorize view needs a session. LOGIN_URL points here.
    #
    # The second sign-in is deliberate, not a gap to close: `mcp/docs/0007` keeps it
    # because consent granted by a session that has not just authenticated says nothing
    # about who granted it. `POST /api/auth/login/` already sets a `sessionid` —
    # dj_rest_auth's SESSION_LOGIN defaults to True — and the SPA discards it by sending
    # no `credentials: "include"`. Unifying would add a line, not remove one.
    #
    # TODO: the open question is the templates, not the logins. Five Django templates and
    #       a second CSS build target exist only to render this flow, and they go away
    #       only if consent moves into the SPA. `mcp/docs/0009` rejects that for now and
    #       its 2026-08-28 amendment says what the gate actually is: not the authorization
    #       code, which stays in django-oauth-toolkit behind one `OAuthLibMixin` call, but
    #       what would authenticate the consent POST. A DRF view authenticates with a JWT,
    #       and a JWT proves someone signed in up to an hour ago — which is the thing 0007
    #       refuses. Reopen when there is an answer to that: a short-lived re-auth token,
    #       or 0007's deferred bridge endpoint minting a fresh session.

    # Both mounts describe the same "/o/" endpoints, because the views reverse their
    # endpoint URLs. They do not agree on `issuer`, which RFC 8414 makes the server's
    # identity: `oauth2_metadata_issuer` derives it from `request.path`, so each mount
    # names itself — "http://host" at the root and "http://host/o" under the prefix.
    #
    # Nothing routes a client to the prefixed copy today, so the two never meet:
    # discovery runs protected-resource document -> `authorization_servers` -> the root
    # document, which is self-consistent. It stops being latent the moment
    # COMPLIANT_BCP_RFC9700_AUTHZ_RESPONSE_ISS is set, because the `iss` parameter comes
    # from `oauth2_authorization_server_issuer`, which reverses
    # `oauth2_provider:oauth-server-metadata` and therefore resolves to the prefixed
    # mount. A client that read the root document then rejects its own authorization
    # response — RFC 9207 compares the two, and RFC 8414 comparison is exact string
    # comparison. Set OIDC_ISS_ENDPOINT alongside that flag and all three agree.
