/**
 * Which cells of a table are selected, and the gestures that choose them: click
 * one, drag for a rectangle, click a grip for a whole row or column, arrow keys
 * to step, shift-arrow to extend.
 *
 * Shift-click does not extend, though every spreadsheet has it, and shift-arrow
 * does — the asymmetry is not a decision but a constraint. Shift is React
 * Flow's `selectionKeyCode`, and while it is held a *pointerdown* on a cell
 * never reaches this component; measured on the guest canvas, Alt and Meta get
 * through and Shift does not. *Keydowns* are untouched, so shift-arrow arrives
 * normally. Restoring shift-click means passing `selectionKeyCode={null}` to
 * the ReactFlow in DFDEditor and GuestDFDEditor, which costs the one thing
 * Shift does on that canvas: starting a selection box from on top of a node
 * instead of moving that node.
 *
 * The gesture is two-stage, as it is in Miro. An unselected table drags from
 * anywhere in its body like every other node; only once it is selected does a
 * press on a cell belong to the table, and the table is then moved by dragging
 * a grip instead. TableNode enforces that by putting React Flow's `nodrag`
 * class on the cells only while the node is selected, and calling
 * `beginCellSelection` under the same condition.

/**
 * Pointer travel, in screen pixels, past which a press on a cell is a range

 *
 * Arbitrary, within the band every drag-versus-click UI uses. Lower and a click
 * from an unsteady hand selects two cells; higher and a deliberate drag stops
 * picking up the next cell until the pointer is well inside it.
